### EC-Salinity Probe Interface

> Monitor hydroponic nutrient levels or salinity in aquariums, pools, and soil.

- Electrical Conductivity in Siemens
- Total Dissolved Solids in PPM
- Salinity in PSU and PPT
- Temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit

#### What it is

An I2C sensor device, an optional DS18B20 waterproof temperature probe, and a two-electrode EC probe. It measures the conductivity of a solution and converts it into Siemens (S). From that value, it derives total dissolved solids and salinity.

#### Using it

There is extensive [documentation](http://ufire.co/ECSalinity/) on the [specifications](http://ufire.co/ECSalinity/#characteristics), [setup](http://ufire.co/ECSalinity/#getting-started), and [use](http://ufire.co/ECSalinity/#use) of the device. The library to use it is in the Arduino and Particle.io IDE; a python implementation for Raspberry Pi and MicroPython is also available.

```
#include <ECSalinity.h>
EC_Salinity ec;
ec.measureEC();
```

#### Buy it

Visit [ufire.co](http://ufire.co) and buy a board and probe.
